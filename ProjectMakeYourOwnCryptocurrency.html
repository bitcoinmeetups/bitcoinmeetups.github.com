  <em>Developing new cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin, Quark etc.</em><br />
  <br />
  We need our own cryptocurrencies for experimental purposes but it can also be used as a reward for developers etc.<br />
  <br />
  We already have a long list of ideas, several of which are listed in our repository at <a href="http://entrances.github.com">entrances.github.com</a><br />
  <br />
  If you want to invest with cryptocurrencies rather than work you can send a personal bitmessage (see front page of website above) and we can set up a flexible and customized solution.<br />
  <br />
  We need a team of developers to do this. You can contribute by forking us and submitting pull requests.<br />
  <br />
  Starting now.<br />

  Apply by forking this code, adding code and submitting a pull request.<br />
